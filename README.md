# weathersearch

## Description
I made a search bar that would automatically search for any given city and take in the information to show the weather, temperature, wind speed and humidity.
It would also pop up 5 cards that would show the 5 day forecast as well.
It would also put a button underneath that would show my past search history and it is clickable.
